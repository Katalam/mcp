Base context for the project.

# An MCP server framework for Laravel
This project is a Laravel package that makes it really easy to add MCP servers to your Laravel app. Typically, MCP servers are defined in a routes/ai.php file using the Mcp facade:

Mcp::cli('example', ExampleServer::class);

## Coding principles

- Always use `#[Test]` attributes instead of prefixing test methods with `test_`.
